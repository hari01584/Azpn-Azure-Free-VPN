Azure free vpn for students only! (Self hosted/No sketchy services/Fast and free)

This is an alternative secure way of accessing firewall blocked networks using Azure Virtual Machine and self hosted openvpn server! And all that is free of cost!!
## FAQ

#### How much does it cost?

If you are student then azure students plan offers a 100$ credits and freebies for an year, using this credits we can host a simple lightweight VPN server (__Which is totally free__)

#### What do you need?
You simply need a student email ID to verify and get Azure student plans. __preferably university given @.edu account__

## Deployment
~~_Use jupyter notebooks in this repository to create and run VPN, follow the order of the notebook numbering to get a seamless installation experience!_~~
EDIT: To make the deployment process seamless, a google collab notebook is made! All you have to do is to open it, connect with your account and follow steps! [Click here to get link for google collab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jrltUfshELXj_DDDriPMEB-f0oyh0qnh?usp=sharing)
## Is it really free
Don't make me repeat myself, __It really is free!!__
## Word Of Caution
Since the VPN is hosted in Azure, it means you have full control of it, but since everything is routed through Azure servers then I would like to advise not to use this in illegal activities!
